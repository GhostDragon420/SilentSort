# SilentSortIM - Code Explanation

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Code
The core idea behind the code is to automate the sorting of items in a player's inventory within the game *7 Days to Die*. It works by scanning XML files that the game uses to define in-game items, blocks, and loot. This is all handled automatically when certain game events occur, such as when the world loads or when a modding event is triggered.

## ðŸ§© Code Breakdown

### 1. **Trigger Mechanism (Log File Watching)**

The first part of the code listens to the gameâ€™s output log (`output_log*.txt`) for specific events like when the world starts loading. These events are essential for the mod to know when to start parsing the XML files and performing sorting tasks.

#### Example:
```python
# Checking for world load trigger in the log
if "World Loaded" in log_content:
    start_sorting_process()  # Start the inventory scanning process
```

### 2. **XML File Parsing**

Once the trigger is activated, the script begins scanning relevant XML files. It looks for important data, such as item types, storage box locations, and loot definitions. 

#### Example:
```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# Load and parse the items.xml file
tree = ET.parse('items.xml')
root = tree.getroot()

# Find all items
for item in root.findall('item'):
    item_name = item.find('name').text
    item_type = item.find('type').text
    # Store item data in a list for later processing
    items.append({'name': item_name, 'type': item_type})
```

### 3. **Inventory Sorting Logic**

After gathering the data from the XML files, the script then sorts the player's inventory. This can include organizing items by type, grouping similar items together, and ensuring that everything is stored in the most efficient way possible.

#### Example:
```python
def sort_inventory(items):
    # Group items by type or category
    sorted_items = {}
    for item in items:
        if item['type'] not in sorted_items:
            sorted_items[item['type']] = []
        sorted_items[item['type']].append(item)
    
    return sorted_items
```

### 4. **User Configuration**

The user can configure which XML files they want to scan and which specific elements to focus on. This is to prevent unnecessary scanning of irrelevant files and reduce the load on the system.

#### Example:
```python
# User can specify which files to scan
files_to_scan = ['items.xml', 'loot.xml', 'recipes.xml']
```

## ðŸ”§ Code Limitations and Future Plans

- **No Trader Interference**: The mod intentionally excludes any logic that affects traders in the game.
- **Resource Efficiency**: The code is designed to run with minimal system resources, ensuring it works well on older hardware.
- **Cross-Referencing**: Future enhancements may include cross-referencing logic, where items are checked against each other (e.g., to find items made from a specific material).
- **GUI Interface**: We plan to create a GUI to make it easier for users to configure and manage the mod.

### ðŸ“Œ Next Steps:

1. Save the above as `mod_project_breakdown.md` and `code_explanation.md`.
2. You can now share these with collaborators, assistants, or community members to give them full context about your mod, as well as a breakdown of the code and its logic.

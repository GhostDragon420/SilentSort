# SilentSortIM

**SilentSortIM** is a passive inventory management and XML integrity-checking tool for **7 Days to Die** modders and players. It runs alongside your game, assisting with inventory awareness and helping modders catch broken tags or config issues — all without interfering with gameplay or trader mechanics.

> 💡 Designed for resource-limited systems, built to support XML-based modding workflows.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔄 **Passive Startup Integration**  
  Automatically activates alongside game startup (uses log triggers or dummy mod).

- 🧭 **Inventory Assistant**  
  Gives players real-time support for tracking items, crafting needs, and what’s missing.

- 🧪 **Missing/Invalid Tag Scanner**  
  Parses and scans through `items.xml`, `blocks.xml`, `recipes.xml`, and other relevant files to:
  - Detect **missing or undefined references**
  - Flag **orphaned tags**
  - Catch **broken links** between modded XML files

- 🔎 **Optional Cross-Reference Mode**  
  Deep scan mode to trace how an item is used across different XML files.

- 🤝 **Trader-Safe Mode**  
  Automatically skips trader-related files to prevent unintentional mod issues.

- 💻 **Low-Resource Friendly**  
  Designed to work quietly in the background, even on older systems.

## 🗂️ Supported XML Files

SilentSortIM can read and validate tags in the following files (customizable):
- `blocks.xml`
- `items.xml`
- `item_modifiers.xml`
- `recipes.xml`
- `materials.xml`
- `loot.xml`
- `entityclasses.xml`

## 🧠 About the Project

SilentSortIM was born from frustration with cluttered inventories and hard-to-debug mods. It’s designed to **respect modder logic**, avoid exploiting gameplay, and be as plug-and-play as possible — perfect for new scripters and seasoned modders alike.

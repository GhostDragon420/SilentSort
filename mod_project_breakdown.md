# SilentSortIM - Project Breakdown

## üéÆ Overview
SilentSortIM is a modding tool designed for the game *7 Days to Die* to enhance inventory management through an automatic sorting system. This tool works passively by scanning XML files that define in-game mechanics like items, blocks, recipes, and loot. It‚Äôs triggered by in-game events that are logged by the game‚Äôs output logs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Purpose
- **Automate Inventory Sorting**: Organizes the player's inventory without manual input.
- **Minimize Resource Usage**: Ensures low resource usage for players with lower-end machines.
- **Customizable User Control**: Allows modders to select which XML files to scan and process.
- **Avoid Interfering with Core Game Logic**: Specifically avoids interaction with trader mechanics.

### üìù Key Features
- **Trigger-Based**: Automatically starts sorting when game events are logged.
- **XML Parsing**: Scans specific XML files based on their relevance (e.g., `items.xml`, `loot.xml`).
- **Simple to Use**: Easy to understand and configure, even for new modders.
- **Low Resource Impact**: Designed to run efficiently even on older hardware.

## üß† Explanation of Mod Functionality

- **Trigger System**: The system waits for specific in-game events logged in `output_log*.txt` (such as world load/start events) to begin. When the game starts or loads a world, it triggers the mod to begin scanning the relevant XML files.
  
- **XML File Scanning**: Based on the user‚Äôs preferences, the mod scans certain XML files (e.g., `blocks.xml` for storage boxes, `items.xml` for item definitions). It gathers item data like names, types, and quantities, and sorts them in the player‚Äôs inventory.

- **User Control**: The user can choose what files to scan and what parameters to look for. This ensures that the mod doesn‚Äôt scan irrelevant files, keeping things lightweight and customizable.

- **Avoids Trader Logic**: Trader mechanics are excluded from the scanning process, ensuring that the mod doesn't interfere with gameplay involving traders.

- **Future Plans**: Adding optional features such as cross-referencing items (finding items made from certain materials, etc.), and building a GUI for easier configuration.

## üß© Code Overview (Current Progress)

The code has several components:
1. **Game Event Listener**: Listens for world load events via the game‚Äôs log files.
2. **XML Parser**: Scans through the XML files based on the user's configuration and extracts necessary data.
3. **Inventory Organization**: Sorts items in the inventory based on defined rules (e.g., grouping similar items, sorting by type).

### üóÇÔ∏è Relevant Files
- **blocks.xml**: Contains the definitions of game blocks (storage boxes, containers, etc.).
- **items.xml**: Defines all in-game items.
- **loot.xml**: Contains loot definitions which determine what the player can find.
- **recipes.xml**: Details how items are crafted together.

## üîß Next Steps
- **Cross-Referencing**: Build logic to find relationships between items (e.g., all items made from IronIngot).
- **GUI Interface**: Develop a graphical interface for easy configuration of scanning rules.
- **Compatibility**: Prepare the mod to be compatible with Android, assuming initial success with the PC version.
